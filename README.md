# [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Creative](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/)

[Creative](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/) is a one page creative theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

## Current contents

* A home page index.html
* A template gallery page gallery1.html
* This README, which includes information about the tempaltes and the licence.
* The images used on the site, in img.
* The stylesheets used on the site, css.

## Getting Started

* To start with you can edit the pages on github.
  * Just click the repo you want to edit rodstcool.github.io.
  * Then click the file you want to edit eg index.html.
  * Then click the pencil icon at the top right of the file.
  * Edit away.
  * Then click commit at the bottom. NB it's a good idea to put a message here to tell yourself what you were thinking when you changed the file. Using github you can revert to earlier versions if you want to.

* Eventually its a good idea to get editing the files on your own machine.
  * I'd recommed a GUI. [Smart git](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/) seems to be a free client for private users on windows.
  * When you have this, you clone this repository (rodstcool.github.io) to your computer with the GUI.
  * Once you have cloned it edit the files as you normally would.
  * Then you have to put the files back to github, this is a simple three step process:
    * `add` the files you have edited to the staging area.
    * `commit` the changes including a message about what you did.
    * `push` the files to the repository, this means they are now up on the github
  * The next time you want to edit you just `pull` the repository down, git will decide what is new and changed and get the appropriate files.
  * [Here](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) is a simple guide to the process. It gives the command line options that do what I described above and describes them in a little more detail.
  * [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) is a fantastic free resource for leaning many codes, and has an intro to using git, which takes 2 hours max.
  * That's about it, you can always migrate to another hosting service and url in the future if you like.
